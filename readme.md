# Tomahawk
Tomahawk is a fully open source hardware Bitcoin ASIC miner. It is based on the ideas of Bitaxe by Skot and the Open Source Miners United but a complete redesign with some different components. It includes a BM1366 ASIC which is also used in the Antminer S19XP.

DO NOT USE - WORK IN PROGRESS!
